## Outline
We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. 

## The Task
I used this project to further my understanding of TDD. I explored mocks and stubs as a way to improve the performance of my tests and avoid testing dependencies. This project could be expanded to guard against edge cases, many of which have not been accounted for as of yet. 

## User Stories

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
